# Predicting heart disease using machine learning

This notebook looks into various Python-based machine learing and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

We'r going to take the following approach:
1. Problem definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modelling
6. Experimentation

## 1.Problem Definition

In a statement,
> Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?

## 2.Data

The original data came from the Cleavland data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

There is also a version of it available on Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset

## 3.Evaluation 

> If we can 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll pusue the project.

## 4. Features
This is where you'll get different information about each of the features in your data.
